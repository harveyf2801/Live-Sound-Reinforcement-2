% The Abstract
\begin{abstract}
	In this comprehensive report, the planning and design of a large-scale outdoor music event is detailed. The project involves utilising tools such as ArrayCalc to create a bespoke speaker system tailored to the specific needs of a specified band. The careful selection of equipment is justified through thorough research, considering technical specifications and industry standards. The system integration is outlined with a focus on advanced audio networking protocols. Power requirements are calculated using excel, and environmentally friendly solutions and provided. The report culminates in a thorough risk assessment using Microsoft Word, ensuring all potential hazards are identified and addressed. Overall, this project not only delves into the technical intricacies of event planning but also prioritises a seamless and optimal experience for both performers and audiences.

        \subsection{Rigging}
            The main line array's splay over the audience is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:speaker_splay} showing how it performs a full coverage over the whole plane.
